Hi, my name is Tomas and these are my programs that we do at Comenius university in Bratislava (Slovakia), Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Informatics. 
Feel free to use it as you need it, but please be careful of plagiarism.
Every week we have a weekly homework which I publish after the dead line.

You can find the homework assignment here, but only in the Slovak language: www.python.input.sk

Program language: PYTHON;     
Main language: Slovak;  
Translation to: English;
